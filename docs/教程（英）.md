# Mod Tutorial

This tutorial is written assuming you have read the [introduction](https://hcs.coolpage.biz/). If there are any unclear points, please refer to the [introduction](https://hcs.coolpage.biz/) first.

## 1. Survival Tips

### Quick Tips
- It is highly recommended to **disable forced Unicode font** in the language options for better UI display of numbers!
- Enter `/gamerule hcsDifficulty relaxing, standard, challenging` to adjust the game difficulty (default is standard).
- Hold down the left mouse button, then hold the right mouse button to enable digging lock.

### Starting Terrain
Plains are recommended. Plains have lots of grass, abundant food sources, and easy to gather resources. Riverbanks are rich in gravel and clay, an important resource in the early stages.

Avoid starting in areas like snowfields, high mountains, deserts, or barren lands, as these have extreme temperatures and scarce resources.

### Fire Source
> If you can’t remember the recipes, consider installing the JEI mod!

Starting a fire early in the game involves two steps:
1. Craft an unlit campfire.
2. Use a fire bow or fire plow, right-clicking on the campfire until it ignites.

Once ignited, the campfire needs regular fueling (right-click or toss fuel) to keep burning. Otherwise, it will smolder and eventually extinguish.

For torches, note that they now require lighting, and without netherrack in their crafting, crude torches have limited burn time.

### Shelter
- Avoid sealing yourself in a completely dark and enclosed space. Ensure there is light or let moonlight in; otherwise, darkness will kill you with terrifying effects!
- Dirt can no longer be used as a roof (unlike wool). It collapses like sand!
- **Tip**: Early on, use sand to craft sandstone for anti-gravity blocks.

#### Treehouses
Find a tall tree, modify the entrance for parkour-style access, and stay on top while blocking your surroundings to protect against skeletons and spiders.

#### Gravel Caves
Similar to [MITE](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/226.html), this involves finding exposed gravel on mountain slopes, digging out gravel to create a shelter, and blocking the entrance. This provides ample gravel for nighttime excavation but beware of highly perceptive zombie mobs that may dig soft blocks. Use elevated terrain to fend off attacks.

### First Aid
#### Bleeding
Physical injuries increase bleeding severity, but wearing armor can reduce the damage. Mild bleeding stops naturally, but severe bleeding requires timely treatment (bandages or golden apples) to prevent life-threatening consequences.

**Bandage Crafting**:
- Simplified Bandage: 3 Grass Fibers + Fiber String or 1 String
- Regular Bandage:
  | Fiber String or String | Wool | Fiber String or String |
  | -------------------- | ---- | -------------------- |

#### Restoring Max Health
- Early game: Use Resurrecting Grass.
- Late game: Golden apples.

Grass-breaking gives a 0.09% chance of dropping Resurrecting Grass.

#### Pain
Injuries cause this buff, reducing movement speed, attack power, and digging speed. Relieve pain using willow bark, golden apples, Resurrecting Grass, or bandages.
- Obtain willow bark by stripping logs near water (50% chance).

#### Bone Fractures
Falling from heights may result in fractures, severely limiting movement. Treat fractures with splints (craftable with Fiber String/string and sticks).

### Water
Shift + right-click empty-handed to drink unpurified water, incurring penalties:
- Freshwater: 30 seconds of diarrhea (increases thirst and hunger).
- Saltwater: Dehydration debuff.
- 0.5% chance of parasite infection (cure with pumpkin seeds).

Use the starting bottle to collect water and boil it on a campfire to obtain purified water (works for saltwater via distillation in a furnace).

### Food
- Early game: Use spears to hunt animals for food.
- Vegetarians face difficulty; consider eating kelp (can be roasted on a campfire), pumpkins (break into 9 pumpkin slices), seeds, etc.
- Zombies attack animals, so post-daytime, nearby animals might disappear, leaving meat drops.

### Temperature
Stay in temperate biomes early on to avoid complications.

**Warming Methods**:
- Stay near heat sources (lava, fire).
- Run.
- Craft heat packs (e.g., heated leather bags in inventory maintain body temperature).

| Any String | Water Bottle | Any String |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Leather    | Water Bottle | Leather    |
| Leather    | Water Bottle | Leather    |

**Cooling Methods**:
- Get wet.
- Stay in shade.
- Use cold water packs (cool heated packs in a freezer or with soul campfires).

## 2. Stone Age Development
Focus on a nomadic lifestyle early on, moving when resources are exhausted.

### Crafting Stone Tools
Collect resources before crafting:
- Stones: Left-click hard blocks to obtain sharp stone fragments (grinding introduced in Beta 0.15).
- Grass Fibers × 3: Fiber String.
- Sticks: Dropped from grass.

**Stone Cone**: Digging Tool
- Crafting: Sharp Stone Fragment × 1
- Used for digging dirt, gravel, etc.

**Stone Knife**: Cutting, Barking, and Stabbing Tool
- Crafting (mirrored arrangement possible):
  |            | Sharp Stone Fragment     |
  | ---------- | ------------------------ |
  | Rope/String | Short Stick (Stick × 1) |

- Speeds up grass cutting, increases grass fiber drops, strips tree bark, and serves as a simple weapon.

**Stone Spear**: Weapon
- Crafting (mirrored arrangement possible):
  |            | Sharp Stone Fragment |
  | ---------- | -------------------- |
  | Rope/String | Stick               |

- Early-game weapon with +2 attack range and 3 damage.

### Flint Tools
Gather gravel to obtain flint and craft sharp flint fragments by left-clicking hard blocks (or combine 2 stones for a sharp stone).

**Flint Hatchet**: Tree Chopping Tool
- Crafting (mirrored arrangement possible):
  | Sharp Flint Fragment | Rope/String |
  | -------------------- | ---------- |
  |                      | Stick       |

### Wooden Tools
Once sufficient wood is obtained, craft wooden tools (most vanilla wood/stone tools are replaced, except wooden shovels and swords).

**Wooden Shovel**: Efficient digging tool for coarse copper powder collection.

**Wooden Armor**: Provides minor protection.

**Club**: Improvised Weapon
- Wooden Stick (vanilla wooden sword replacement).
- Spiked Club: Higher damage than wooden sticks; crafted using a stick + sharp bone/sharp flint fragment.

**Improvised Shield**: Low-durability alternative to vanilla shields.

| Wooden Plank |          | Wooden Plank |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Wooden Plank | Wooden Plank | Wooden Plank |
|              | Wooden Plank |              |

## 3. Preparing for Mining
### Crafting a Pickaxe
#### Gathering Copper Powder
Dig gravel to collect coarse copper powder. Nine units combine into one coarse copper.

**Copper Smelting**:
To make copper ingots from coarse copper powder, you need to make a furnace.
How to make it? This module has added a new formula for the initial stage - brick synthesis
The production steps are as follows:
1. Use a bonfire to burn clay balls into red bricks
2. Red bricks x 4 → brick block x 1
3. Craft a furnace:

|brick block | brick block | brick block|
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|brick block | | brick block|
|brick block | brick block | brick block|

**Cave Oxygen Issues**:
At y < 42, oxygen depletion begins, fully suffocating in 300 seconds. Plant foliage, drink water-breathing potions, or equip helmets with respiration enchantments.

**Geological Temperature**:
- y 44-64: Gradual influence reduction.
- y < 44: Rising temperature, leading to overheating near y = -9.

## 4. Nether Exploration
### Netherite Armor Necessity
Diamond gear is nerfed (7 armor points), but netherite remains unaffected. Mine ancient debris for better equipment.

### Heat and Sanity
Nether’s heat requires cooling measures (e.g., cold water packs). Sanity drops continually; carry sanity-restoring foods (dried seeds, jerky).

### Enhanced Mobs
Piglin aggression triggers upon eye contact. Ghast and blaze projectiles deal significantly more damage.

## 5. Improving Quality of Life
### Extending Food Shelf Life
**Drying Rack**:
- Crafting:
  | Stick | Stick    | Stick |
  | ----- | -------- | ----- |
  | Stick | Fiber String | Stick |
  | Stick |          | Stick |

- Meat or kelp dries in 2 days (if not rained on) into jerky or dried kelp.

**Fridge**:
- Crafting:
  | Iron Ingot | Redstone Block | Iron Ingot |
  | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
  | Iron Ingot | Chest          | Iron Ingot |
  | Iron Ingot | Iron Ingot     | Iron Ingot |

- Triples food shelf life.

### Addressing Low Sanity
- Sleep (costs water and hunger).
- Consume food like jerky, mushroom stew.
- Low-cost sanity restoration:
  - Roast seeds.
  - Dried kelp.
  - Cook cactus meat (crafted from cactus blocks).

### Mod Utility Potions
1. **Iron Skin Potion**: Grants resistance (Iron Nugget + Rough Potion).
2. **Return Potion**: Teleports to spawn point (Salmon + Rough Potion).
3. **Mining Potion**: Grants haste (Red Mangrove Propagule + Rough Potion).
